Notes:

- Prevent reset on serial traffic by connecting a 120 ohm resistor
   to RESET and 5V 
   - Note that this will prevent uploading while the resistor is connected.


- Roll yourself a private key, something along the lines of:
PRIVATE_KEY = "dontactuallyusethisstringyoupillock"
  (you can roll your own in irb using
(0..31).collect { ('a'..'z').to_a[rand(26)] }.join
  )
  and throw it in (the gitignored file) config/initializers/constants.rb
