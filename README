- Prevent reset on serial traffic by connecting a 120 ohm resistor
   to RESET and 5V 
   - Note that this will prevent uploading while the resistor is connected.

- Resistor trick above is NOT necessary on account of reseting on restart not being an issue.

- Roll yourself a private key using
  (0..31).collect { ('a'..'z').to_a[rand(26)] }.join
  and throw it in (the gitignored file) config/initializers/constants.rb
  # idea from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1107782/wheres-the-best-place-to-define-a-constant-in-a-ruby-on-rails-application/1108064#1108064
  along with the serial port you are using.  Your constants.rb file should end up looking something like:

PRIVATE_KEY = "dontactuallyusethisstringyoupillock"
SERIAL_PORT = "/dev/ttyUSB0"

- Typical commands to use after cloning the repo:
  - [Create constants.rb]
  - bundle install
  - rake db:migrate
  - rails server -d

Notes on getting feeder running on Windows
==========

Used the Windows installer from http://railsinstaller.org/  It worked amazingly well.

Followed these instructions:

http://curiosity.roguepenguin.net/?p=35

Which may have built and installed an older, Windows compatible binary version of the gem (0.6).

feeder was complaining that it couldn't find serialport 1.0.4, so I renamed the Gemfile.lock to Gemfile.lock.bak, thinking I'd have to run bundler again or something.  But on a lark, I just tried rake db:migrate again, and it worked.  Some part of this excruciating process probably wasn't necessary.
