Notes:

- Prevent reset on serial traffic by connecting a 120 ohm resistor
   to RESET and 5V 
   - Note that this will prevent uploading while the resistor is connected.


- Roll yourself a private key, something along the lines of:
PRIVATE_KEY = "dontactuallyusethisstringyoupillock"
  and throw it in (the gitignored file) config/initializers/constants.rb
